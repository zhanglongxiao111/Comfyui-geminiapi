# ComfyUI-ExternalAPI-Helpers

A collection of powerful custom nodes for ComfyUI that connect your local workflows to closed-source AI models via their APIs. Use Google's Gemini, Imagen, Veo, OpenAI's GPT-Image-1, and Black Forest Labs' FLUX models directly within ComfyUI.



## Key Features

*   **FLUX Kontext Pro & Max:** Image-to-image transformations using the FLUX models via the Replicate API.
*   **Gemini Chat:** Google's powerful multimodal AI. Ask questions about an image, generate detailed descriptions or create prompts for other models. Supports thinking budget controls for applicable models.
*   **Gemini Segmentation:** Generate segmentation masks for objects in an image using Gemini.
*   **GPT Image Edit:** OpenAI's `gpt-image-1` for prompt-based image editing and inpainting. Simply mask an area and describe the change you want to see.
*   **Google Imagen Generator & Edit:** Create and edit images with Google's Imagen models, with support for Vertex AI.
*   **Nano Banana:** A creative image generation node using a specialized Gemini model.
*   **Veo Text-to-Video:** Generate high-quality video clips from text prompts using Google's Veo model via Vertex AI.
*   **Seamless Integration:** All nodes are designed to work seamlessly with standard ComfyUI inputs (IMAGE, MASK, STRING) and outputs, allowing you to chain them into complex and creative workflows.
*   **Secure & Simple:** Simply provide your API key in the node's input field to get started.

## ðŸ”‘ Prerequisites: API Keys

All nodes in this collection require API keys to function.

*   **FLUX Nodes (Replicate):** You will need a [Replicate API Token](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens).
*   **Gemini, Imagen, and Nano Banana Nodes:** You will need a [Google AI Studio API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys).
*   **GPT Image Edit Node:** You will need an [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
*   **Vertex AI Nodes (Imagen Edit, Veo):** You will need a Google Cloud Project ID, a service account with appropriate permissions, and the location for the resources.

You can paste your key directly into the `api_key` field on the corresponding node. For Vertex AI nodes, you will need to provide the project ID, location, and path to your service account JSON file.

## ðŸ“š Node Guide

### Flux Kontext Pro / Max

These nodes allow you to transform an input image based on a text prompt. They are ideal for applying artistic styles or making significant conceptual changes to an existing image.

*   **Category:** `image/edit`
*   **Inputs:**
    *   `image`: The source image to transform.
    *   `prompt`: A text description of the desired output (e.g., "A vibrant Van Gogh painting", "Make this a 90s cartoon").
    *   `replicate_api_token`: Your API token from Replicate.
    *   `aspect_ratio`: The desired output aspect ratio. `match_input_image` is highly recommended to preserve the original composition.
    *   `output_format`: `jpg` or `png`.
    *   `safety_tolerance`: Adjust the content safety filter level.
*   **Output:**
    *   `image`: The generated image.

### Gemini Chat

A versatile node for text generation and image analysis. Use it to understand an image's content or to generate creative text for other nodes.

*   **Category:** `text/generation`
*   **Inputs:**
    *   `prompt`: The text prompt or question you want to ask the model.
    *   `image` (Optional): An input image for the model to analyze.
    *   `api_key`: Your API key from Google AI Studio.
    *   `model`: The Gemini model to use (e.g., `gemini-2.5-pro`).
    *   `system_instruction` (Optional): Provide context or rules for how the model should behave.
    *   `temperature`: Controls the creativity of the output. Higher is more creative.
    *   `thinking`: Enables the model's thinking/reasoning process (Gemini 2.5 Pro).
*   **Output:**
    *   `response`: The text generated by the Gemini model.

### Gemini Segmentation

This node uses a Gemini model to generate segmentation masks for specified objects within an image.

*   **Category:** `image/generation`
*   **Inputs:**
    *   `image`: The source image for segmentation.
    *   `segment_prompt`: A text description of the objects to segment (e.g., "the car", "all people").
    *   `api_key`: Your API key from Google AI Studio.
    *   `model`: The Gemini model to use.
    *   `...other_params`: Controls for temperature, thinking, and seed.
*   **Output:**
    *   `mask`: A black and white mask of the segmented objects.

### GPT Image Edit

This node uses OpenAI's API to perform powerful, prompt-based inpainting and editing.

*   **Category:** `image/edit`
*   **Inputs:**
    *   `image`: The source image to edit.
    *   `mask` (Optional): A black and white mask. The model will edit the **white area** of the mask.
    *   `prompt`: A description of the edit to perform (e.g., "Add a small red boat on the water", "Remove the person on the left").
    *   `api_key`: Your API key from OpenAI.
